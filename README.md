# Setup macOS using zsh

This is a collection of scripts to setup your macOS.

They are designed for the neue fische web development course.

## Instructions

You should have the latest macOS installed. To make sure, click on the apple logo at the top left, go to "About this Mac" and click "Software Update". Install any missing updates.

Find and run the program "Terminal". This is a program that allows you to run commands on your computer. You can press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> to open Spotlight. Type in the program's name and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Copy the command you want to run and paste it into the Terminal.  
Run it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

> 💡 In case of any errors, carefully read the error text and google for help. Ask a coach for help if you can't find a solution with your own research.

### Which commands should I run?

Begin with the [_General Setup_](#-general-setup). You can optionally run the [_Setting nicer macOS Configurations_](#-setting-nicer-macos-configurations) script at any time.

The [_Setting up git and GitHub_](#-setting-up-git-and-github) script will be used once you'll need to work with git in the command line.

> 💡 You can check the "What does this do?" sections to learn what each script does in detail.

## 💻 General Setup

Installs desktop applications, command line tools and sets up the shell.

> 💡 Enter your macOS users password if you're asked for it and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You won't see any characters while typing, but it's still working.
>
> If you are asked to enable fuzzy auto-completion, enable key bindings and update shell configuration files confirm by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```sh

Using fnm the script will install the latest [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) a JavaScript runtime.

The script will use npm to install the following packages globally:

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code

## 🍏 Setting nicer macOS Configurations

_This script is optional, but it might make your macOS experience nicer._ 🤓

Some of the default macOS settings are not very optimized for productivity. This script will change some of them.

> 💡 Enter your macOS users password if you're asked for it and confirm with <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You won't see any characters while typing, but it's still working.

```sh
zsh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuefische/web-setup/main/setup-macos)
```

<details>
<summary>What does this do?</summary>

This command will download the [`setup-macos` script](/setup-macos) from GitHub and run it on your computer.

The script will change the following macOS settings:

- disable disk eject warning
- set dock autohide timings to feel more responsive
- make hidden apps transparent in the dock
- remove recent apps from the dock
- set key repeat to feel more responsive
- set show all files in Finder (including hidden ones)
- make home folder the default location in Finder
- disable automatic spelling correction

> 💡 If you want only some of the settings to be applied, copy the relevant lines from the [setup script](/setup-macos) and run them in the Terminal.
>
> Don't forget to run `killall Dock && killall Finder` (or restart you computer) to apply the changes.
